# Api boilerplate

## Requirements

* Nodejs

## Setup

## Setup the app.

Install dependencies

```
$ npm i
```

Run your server

```
$ npm start
```

your app should be available at [localhost:3003](http://localhost:3003)

## Testing

A [Mocha](https://mochajs.org/) test harness has been set up. Tests are found in
the `test` directory, replicating the style of a Rails/Sails application where
the directory structure from `app` is (basically) mirrored inside `test`.

To execute the tests one time, execute `npm test` (or `npm run test`). To
execute the tests in "watch-mode" (where tests will be run after every file
change), execute `npm run test:watch`.
